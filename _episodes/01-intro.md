## Variables

Any Python interpreter can be used as a calculator:
~~~
3 + 5 * 4
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
23
~~~
{: .output}

This is great but not very interesting.
To do anything useful with data, we need to assign its value to a _variable_.
In Python, we can [assign]({{ page.root }}/reference/#assign) a value to a
[variable]({{ page.root }}/reference/#variable), using the equals sign `=`.
For example, to assign value `60` to a variable `weight_kg`, we would execute:

~~~
weight_kg = 60
~~~
{: .language-python}

From now on, whenever we use `weight_kg`, Python will substitute the value we assigned to
it. In layman's terms, **a variable is a name for a value**.

In Python, variable names:

 - can include letters, digits, and underscores
 - cannot start with a digit
 - are [case sensitive]({{ page.root }}/reference/#case-sensitive).

This means that, for example:
 - `weight0` is a valid variable name, whereas `0weight` is not
 - `weight` and `Weight` are different variables

## Types of data
Python knows various types of data. Three common ones are:

* integer numbers
* floating point numbers, and
* strings.

In the example above, variable `weight_kg` has an integer value of `60`.
To create a variable with a floating point value, we can execute:

~~~
weight_kg = 60.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

And to create a string, we add single or double quotes around some text, for example:

~~~
weight_kg_text = 'weight in kilograms:'
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Using Variables in Python
To display the value of a variable to the screen in Python, we can use the `print` function:

~~~
print(weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
60.0
~~~
{: .output}

We can display multiple things at once using only one `print` command:

~~~
print(weight_kg_text, weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}
~~~
weight in kilograms: 60.0
~~~
{: .output}

Moreover, we can do arithmetic with variables right inside the `print` function:

~~~
print('weight in pounds:', 2.2 * weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
weight in pounds: 132.0
~~~
{: .output}

The above command, however, did not change the value of `weight_kg`:
~~~
print(weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
60.0
~~~
{: .output}

To change the value of the `weight_kg` variable, we have to
**assign** `weight_kg` a new value using the equals `=` sign:

~~~
weight_kg = 65.0
print('weight in kilograms is now:', weight_kg)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
weight in kilograms is now: 65.0
~~~
{: .output}
